More and more parts of our lives are becoming dependent on programming,
yet most of us do not start learning about it until high school or later.
Code literacy is a core skill that is becoming as important as English literacy,
so it makes sense to start as early as possible.

The main problem with learning programming is that it's difficult.
It's difficult because useful programs require additional skills that children
might not have developed, including math and dealing with abstract objects.
It's also difficult because the primary method of programming is typing on a
keyboard, which children might not have learned yet.

All of that difficulty makes programming scary and frustrating, rather than
fun, as it could be. Funk is a drag and drop programming language meant to
teach kids how to think in terms of programs - the semantics of programming -
while isolating them from the syntax and other difficult concepts.

It deals with concrete physical objects that they can reason with on an intuitive level,
all delivered through a touch device, which is more accessible to children than a keyboard.
Funk is geared around levels, which are each highly modular and can be created by
anyone, including educators and parents, without requiring any programming experience.
Each level, the user has to turn some given input(s) into a specific output, through various
ways of processing the input, exactly like how one constructs a function in practical progrmaming languages.


# Todo
- potentially use interact.js library?
- label output of each block
- introduce more robust combination system
- introduce pictures accompanying objects
- limit input output of all blocks (like Simulink)
	- snapping of input to output (would have to make them draggable objects as well)
- add background
- add level navigation/overview screen
- add more guidance to tutorial levels
